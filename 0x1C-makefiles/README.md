Description
ALX 0x1C - Makefiles is a project that focuses on demystifying Makefiles, a powerful tool used to automate the build process of software projects. Through this project, we will learn to create efficient build systems, manage dependencies, and simplify complex compilation processes.

What is a Makefile?
A Makefile is a plain text file used to define a set of rules and instructions for building software projects. It specifies the relationships between different source code files, dependencies, and the commands needed to compile, link, and generate executable programs.

How It Works
Learn: Study the basics of Makefiles, including syntax, rules, variables, and targets.

Create: Practice creating Makefiles for simple and complex projects. Understand how to structure rules and dependencies.

Optimize: Explore advanced techniques to optimize build processes, handle different file types, and manage project configurations.

Collaborate: Engage in discussions about Makefiles, share insights, and help each other solve challenges.
